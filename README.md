# GitHub Actions Workflow

Welcome to this repository! Here, we've set up a GitHub Actions workflow file (`main.yml`) to help automate common tasks in your Node.js project, like checking dependencies, building, testing, and deploying your code.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool provided by GitHub that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly within your GitHub repository. Workflows are defined in YAML files and can be triggered by various events, such as pushes, pull requests, or scheduled events.

## Workflow Overview

Here's what's happening:

- We've set up the workflow to run every time you push changes to the `main` branch.
- The workflow has a single job called `check`, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- In the `check` job, we first check out your code using `actions/checkout`, then we install dummy dependencies using `npm install`, and finally, we perform a simple check task.

## Workflow Configuration

Let's break down the configuration in the `main.yml` file:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Dummy Dependencies
        run: |
          echo '{"dependencies": {"dummy-package": "1.0.0"}}' > package.json
          npm install
      - name: Check
        run: |
          echo "Check"
```

# Usage

Using this workflow in your own project is easy:

1. Copy the contents of `main.yml` to your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Customize the workflow as needed to fit your project's requirements. You can modify the `package.json` file and the tasks in the workflow file to suit your specific needs.
3. That's it! Now, every time you push changes to your `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow for you.
